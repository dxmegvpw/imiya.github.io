    <h2>For writing the senior thesis</h2>

    <p>
        &emsp13;
        When I finished my undergraduate degree, I had to write a thesis. Without exception, I also had to write a thesis, but there are no documents written about the know-how, so here I will share some notes on writing a thesis in my laboratory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before moving on to the main topic, let me share a bit of information about my research field, because the situation in writing the thesis, as I think, varies across fields. My main research field was particle physics, with a more detailed focus on phenomenology.
